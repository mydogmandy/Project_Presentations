Spotfire education + Peak LTC by Scan Time Presentations


## Please feel free to browse through two presentations I created based off may past projects.

* The Spotfire Education was created to educate a class of 30 teammates from all over the US in a centralized location.
* Basic instructions & walkthroughs were created to ensure each member left the 3-day class with the ability to create data visuals in the Spotfire developer program.
* Peak LTC by Scan Time was a group project stemming from my discovery of how to effectively reduce shipping delivery exceptions by focusing efforts on time groups, rather than solely individuals or customers.
